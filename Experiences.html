      The very first day of the DMGD E-15 class, I came in and the class started with analyzing some of the digital media adds. People in the class started commenting about what they saw and what it meant to them. 
        There were lots of perspectives about that 1 minute adds and I am thinking in my head, are all these people really new to this class?? Seemed like they really understood what’s going on here.<br>  
        Being a first timer to anything makes people a little fearful, you wana be right and spot-on but I didn’t sensed anything like that amongst the group. 
        For me when I will look at something, it’s just getting to know about something new that came in to market and how people within it looked (Presence wise).<br> 
        Hearing all those different perspectives gave me a different way to think about what I see. Something inside me thought they are really good at “JUDGING”.<br> 
        I am a business analyst by profession and I analyze many documents, systems and requirements for work each day but its almost real life..
        one can buy that product being advertised. Thinking about what message is being sent though the add other than “it’s a new product, buy it” gave me a new outlook.
        It was always like getting the message that something new is in town..

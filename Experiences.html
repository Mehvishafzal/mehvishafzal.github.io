      The very first day of the DMGD E-15 class, I came in and the class started with analyzing some of the digital media adds. 
      People in the class started commenting about what they saw and what it meant to them. 
      There were lots of perspectives about those 2-3 minute adds and I was thinking in my head, are all these people really new to this class??
      Seems like they really know what to say..<br>
      Being a first timer, to anything makes people fearful generally but I didn’t sense anything like that amongst the group.
      Most people were really confident in saying what they observed and the instructors echoed with their observations. 
      Something inside me thought these people are really good at “JUDGING”. <br>
      For me when I look at something, mostly it’s with half my attention sidetracked somewhere else and the other half is just enough 
      to know that something new came into the market and people within the add looked nicer OR NOT (Presence wise).<br>  
      Hearing a bunch of different perspectives made me feel there is more to these adds than just vending products.
      You must be thinking why am even taking this course if I have no interest in what message is being communicated 
      through these expressive means. Well, I design stuff for living and that’s been my focus all along UNTILL I got myself in to
      DGMD E 15. When I was registering this course I thought it would equip me with different techniques to enhance what I love to
      do but the story changed upside down well a little sideways if not upside down.<br>
      Then we were given a person card assignment to work on. We were to look at already written code and come up with a card for your
      partner (person sitting next to you). I got Susan Cantrell as my partner. <br>
      I left class that night overwhelmed. Talked to my husband all the way back home about how people think about different things 
      and how perspectives differ from person to person and culture to culture. He listened silently all along, I guess he was also 
      amazed at the idea of me being so excited about this new perspective I got that night.<br>
